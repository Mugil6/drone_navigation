# üöÅ Explainable Drone Navigation (UAV123 + YOLOv8 + Jetson)

This project implements an **autonomous drone navigation pipeline** using the **UAV123 dataset** with **YOLOv8** for object detection.  
We extend it with **Grad-CAM explainability** so that navigation decisions can be visually interpreted.  
The project also supports **real-time deployment on NVIDIA Jetson (Nano/Xavier)** with TensorRT acceleration.
